  <h3 id="chicken">Chicken</h3>
  <p>Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (aka BSCBs) is there anything more boring? They are all too often overcooked until dry and chewy, and I generally prefer more succulent boneless, skinless thighs. But for lunch and dinner favorites like chicken Caesar salad and chicken pasta, sliced juicy chicken breasts can't be beat. They're a great staple for quick lunches, too.</p>

  <h3 id="beef">Beef</h3>
  <p>Beef Stroganoff, named for a family of long pedigree in czarist Russia, was a reigning party favorite a generation ago and is one of my leading nominees for a return from limbo. The dish started being extolled in the 1930s by members of the self-styled “gourmet” movement in the United States.</p>

  <h3 id="sushi">Sushi</h3>
  <p>Have you ever had umeshiso maki sushi? The next time you are in a sushi bar, ask the chef if they can make it for you. It's a simple maki roll with two fillings; umeboshi pickled plums and fresh shiso leaves. The saltiness of the plum contrasts nicely with the freshness of the shiso. It's also very easy to make at home.</p>
